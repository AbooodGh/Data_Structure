# 🧬 Data Structures Implementation (C++)

A comprehensive collection of fundamental **Data Structures** implemented from scratch using **C++**. This project focuses on efficient memory management, algorithm optimization, and clean **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** design.

## 🚀 Key Implementations
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of dynamic data structures for efficient data storage.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Core structures for managing data flow (LIFO/FIFO).
- **Generic Programming**: Using **Templates** to ensure the structures work with any data type.
- **Memory Management**: Proper use of pointers and destructors to ensure no memory leaks.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
- **Modular Code**: Each data structure is organized within its own logic for easy reusability.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows C++ best practices and naming conventions.
- **Visual Studio Integration**: Includes solution files for immediate setup.

## 📂 Project Organization
- `*.h`: Core logic and class definitions for each data structure.
- `main.cpp`: Test cases and demonstrations of each structure in action.
- `DataStructure.slnx`: Visual Studio solution for instant setup and debugging.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local device.
2. Open the `DataStructure.slnx` file using **Visual Studio**.
3. Build and run the project to see the test results in the console.
