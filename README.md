# 🧬 Data Structures Implementation (C++)

A comprehensive collection of fundamental **Data Structures** implemented from scratch using **C++**. This project focuses on efficient memory management, algorithm optimization, and clean **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** design.

## 🚀 Implemented Structures
This repository includes professional implementations of:
- **Linked Lists**: Single Linked List, Doubly Linked List.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Array-based and Linked-list-based implementations.
- **Trees**: Binary Search Trees (BST) and basic tree traversal algorithms.
- **Utility Classes**: Custom implementations for handling strings and dates within structures.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
- **Generic Programming**: Extensive use of **Templates** to support multiple data types.
- **Memory Management**: Proper use of pointers, constructors, and destructors to prevent memory leaks.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Each structure is optimized for time and space complexity.
- **Modular Design**: Every data structure is encapsulated in its own header file (`.h`) for reusability.

## 📂 Project Organization
- `*.h`: Core logic and class definitions for each data structure.
- `main.cpp`: Test cases and demonstrations of each structure in action.
- `DataStructure.slnx`: Visual Studio solution for instant setup and debugging.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `DataStructure.slnx` file using **Visual Studio**.
3. Build and run the project to see the test results in the console.
